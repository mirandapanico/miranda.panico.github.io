<center> <p> I reside in a town called Scarborough, which is right outside of Portland, Maine. It is very spread out so each part of my town has something
new to offer. I am very fortunate to live in a neighborhood with a park behind us, a beautiful marsh infrontof us, the Eastern Trail to one side, 
and the ocean on the other side just down theroad. I grew up playing soccer at the fields behind my house and going to the snack shack for random 
food on summer nights during Little League baseball games. When I go bike the Eastern Trail, I always make sure to wear a bathing suit under my 
clothes so I can stop and jump off the bridge to cool off on my way home. </center> </p>
