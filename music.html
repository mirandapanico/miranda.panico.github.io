<center> <p>I am one of those people who is constantly listening to music throught out my day. As soon as I wake up in the morning, I put on music 
and listen to it as I get ready and go to class. I listen to a very diverse array of music including rap, country, pop, rock, Hispanic, and more. 
I'm not very picky and love hearing other people's music to broaden my horizons. I finding new music on YouTube, Pandora, and Spotify. Spotify is 
definitely my favorite music outlet because I can make playlists and also see what my friends are listening to. If you want to check out what types
of things I listen to, check out my Spotify link below. </p> </center>
