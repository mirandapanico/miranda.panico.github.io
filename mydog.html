	<H1>My Dog</H1>
<center> <p>My dog's name is Brody and he is a Labradoodle. His mom was a Yellow Lab and his dad was a white Standard Poodle. Brody is a little bigger than most
dogs, weighing in at 95 pounds. He has a very intimiating bark, but he is super cute and super friendly. He loves to cuddle and seems to think he is a 
lap dog because he has no problem sitting on you and falling asleep. Brody is 9 years old now, turning 10 next month, but still acts like a puppy and 
never seems to run out of energy. He loves car rides and sniffing around new places so he's great to go on adventures with. His head is absurdly big 
for his large body, which people always comment on. Brody is probably the goofiest dog I've ever come across and seems to get goofier with every day
that passes. I love when I get to go home and snuggle him. </center> </p>
