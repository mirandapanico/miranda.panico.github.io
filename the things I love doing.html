	<H1>The Things I Love Doing</H1>
<center> <p>As a college student, I don't have much time to do all the things I would like to when I'm at school due to classes, studying, etc. 
When I do find myself with extra time in a day, I love to play lacrosse, go on car rides with friends and explore all the great places 
Maine has to offer, and many other things. During the summer, I spend my time either at work or at the beach. I live such a short distance
away from both, which is great on gas. Laying in the sun at Pine Point or Higgins Beach is definitely my favorite thing to do. Unfortuantely, 
no matter how hot the day, that ocean never seems to be warm enough. Once you ease yourself in, it becomes a blessing in the blistering sun. 
I also love body surfing and letting the waves bring me back to shore. Nothing beats a warm summer day. And on top of that, a day well spent with 
friends! My friends and family mean everything to me and spending time with them is by far by favorite hobby. It's all about having fun and making 
memories. </p> </center>
